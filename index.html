           <h5 class="mt-5">Preparing Mentally for The Trip</h5>
           <p class="lead">After hearing about the assignment, there were a lot of things going on in my head. One of them was where will I go? To be honest I still haven’t come up with a place to visit. Hopefully this article will help me find what I’m looking for. About the assignment, I was asked to write 10 blogs and make a 10min video on it. Sounds interesting right? It is! </p>
           <p class="lead">My preparation for completing this assignment starts today and this will sort of be my first blog. After listening to a lot of opinions & suggestions on where do I head to, to make my video I think I’ll be visiting a temple in Shimla which is nearly 225kms away from the University. I think this is a good place to start mentally. I would like to experience how life is like in the capital oh Himachal Pradesh. So, I’m thinking I’ll pack my camera, lens, microphone and head out tomorrow to Shimla. After researching, I found out that there are only a few buses that go to this place so I needed to be on time. The first bus from Dharamshala leaves at 6 am. It means I had to wake up at 4.30 am, freshen up and leave my room before 5.30 am. So, you might be wondering why Shimla? Why not some other place in Himachal, like Chamba valley or Spiti Valley or Mandi. There’s way more concentration of temples in those regions. But the thing is these regions were risky to consider as we are nearing heavy snowfall. Month of December is the worst for travelling to these regions. Hence the safer option was Shimla. There were at least 10 temples that I found nearby Shimla. But I went for the closest one to the bus stand to keep it hassle free and to also keep it in walking distance incase if I needed to. 
            The alarm goes off. I woke up as soon as I heard the sound. For some reason I tend to wake up on the very time I set my alarm for especially on important occasions, which obviously is a good thing. So, I woke up sharp at 4.30am. Went straight into the bathroom. It was very cold, but to overcome it I thought about Shimla on how much colder it would be there and that this is nothing. It worked! I was ready. Packed some home cooked Pulao, I’m sorry I cannot call it Vegetable Biriyani. Packed 2 boxes of it which I had made prior night. Stepped out of my room at 5.30 am. I could see my own breath. It was as if I was smoking. I rarely get up this early so it felt refreshing. I went into the ATM and withdrew 2000 rupees. Reached the bus stand and there it was, my ride to Shimla. I sat inside the bus waiting for the driver to start the bus.
