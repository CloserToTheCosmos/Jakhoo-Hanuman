            <h5 class="mt-5">The Getaway Begins</h5>
            <p class="lead">The engines turned on and so did my excitement switch. I normally am neutral about touring, but this felt different. I could feel this was going to be a good trip. A trip that will be under my control. This made me calmer and more confident. The bus started moving. It was still dark outside. Two more of my classmates joined the party. Apparently, they too were heading to Shimla. If only this was true. </p>
            <p class="lead">What actually happened was that one of my classmates wanted to go to Shimla. He called me and asked “Would you like to go to Shimla with me?” I thought to myself why not. There was a weekend coming up and I had nothing else to do. So, I said, “yes, I’d love to join”. Little did I know he was going to meet his girlfriend. Then at the very end moment I came to know he was also bringing his other friend along. So, there were three of us going to Shimla. Just when I thought I had it all under control. Life… right? I put on my headphones, put on Interstellar main theme played by Hans Zimmer on loop, watched the sunrise whilst enjoying the music. I was trying to finish scripting and preparing questions for the video. It was hard. It took time. People hopped in and out of the bus as we progressed through the journey. And then we stopped for lunch at this place called Bilaspur. That’s when I got my ideas rushing for the script. I scribbled it down onto a notebook. Now a sense of relief and confidence rushed inside me. I felt more ready. I ate my packed Pulao and my classmates had tea. I would have offered them the extra box I had packed but I didn’t like these guys. Then after 8 hours of travelling I finally reached Shimla. To cut on room expenses which are extremely expensive in Shimla, I had a plan of staying in Gurudwara. But since now I had company, I couldn’t just abandon them. I suggested them to stay with me in Gurudwara but they didn’t take it well. Apparently, it didn’t go well with their esteem. So, they suggested to book a room and share it by three. And the other guy had connections with Forest Department Rest house so he got us in. Now we could stay in Shimla easily for two nights in a semi-luxury room at the cost of a pizza. This rest house was 4kms away from the Old Bus stand and 3.5kms away from the temple. This too was in the range of “my walking capacity”. The room was nearby the woods. Definitely gave a forest rest house vibe. Even the interior of the room was made of wood. There was a room heater, a huge geyser, King size bed and some warm quilts. All three of us could sleep there comfortably. So, the first thing we did was unpack, freshen up and go visit The Ridge. </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">A Beautiful Night At The Ridge</h5>
            <p class="lead">Got on a bus to the Lift. There’s a lift that takes you up to The Ridge. It is a place where you can shop, eat, walk around, explore, visit St. Christ Church, sit in a park and so much more. So, we got off at the lift and went inside to buy tickets to the lift. It costs 10 rupees each per person. Waited in a line to board the lift, because that’s how many people had come to spend their weekend in Shimla. </p>
            <p class="lead">Up we came, the lift door opened. One of my classmates wanted to try on a sweater. So went from showroom to showroom but ended up buying nothing. Typical Indians isn’t it. At this point all three of us were hungry. So, we went looking out for a place to eat which was not too fancy but also filling. We found a tea stall which had a lot more items than just tea. So, we ordered Pakoras and tea. The Pakoras were good, crispy and soft at the same time. My eyes suddenly laid on these sweets made from jaggery. They are my favorite, yet I don’t know what they are called. So, I got half a kilo of those. My classmates still wanted to eat more and off we went looking for more shops. There were a lot of restaurants, cafes, bars along the way but none of them suited our budget. Student life truly disappoints me. After a lot of searching, we found a bakery which had a lot of variety. Both my classmates ordered this long burger kind of things. One was a chicken filled burger and the other was paneer capsicum filled burger. I was full from all the pakoras and jaggery sweet. Hence, I didn’t feel like eating anything else. Then one of my classmates wanted to have beer. But the other guy opposed it because he doesn’t drink. I was neutral because I didn’t even like beer. So, they quarreled and debated for like 30 mins about this. But they came to a conclusion that he could have beer tomorrow night. Glad that ended because it was getting colder and colder as the night passed by. At this point it was 7 pm and the temperature was 0 degrees. Weird thing about my body is that I don’t feel cold anywhere in my body except my feet and palms. And my palms were freezing and I couldn’t move them freely. Luckily, I found a bonfire put up by a street vendor. I quickly sat down and put my hands into the fire. I literally did it. Felt great, nice and warm. And after warming my hands I only removed my hands from my pockets if it was absolutely necessary. We then went in search of a gift for one of the guy’s girlfriend. Lot of options but low budget. Another typical Indian scenario. So, all three of us decided to only have a look at the entire bazaar and we would come back for purchase the next day.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">End of Day One</h5>
            <p class="lead">After looking at numerous shops, we were tired. All three of us decided to go back to the room. One of the classmates told me that he has brought around 10 chapatis with pickle hence we should buy some gravy for it and finish it. I hate wasting food and I would have definitely agreed to this. But I was genuinely full. I finished all of the jaggery sweet by myself. So, I said we shall go back walking to the room and if I feel like I can eat more we will buy gravy there. </p>
            <p class="lead">We left the ridge and came down to where the lift was. It was closed and we had no other choice but to walk extra. I find walking in cold fun. I have always fancied colder places. Shimla at night is truly beautiful, in fact it looks way more beautiful at night compared to day. Obviously, I went taking pictures along the way. If you want to see what I captured go checkout my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/closer_to_the_cosmos/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>  page. I promise this isn’t a self-promotion, or is it? Anyway, while we were coming down the road surrounded by woods one of my classmates was walking along side me and the other one was barely catching up. He tried to scare me by telling me that there are leopards here and they could pounce on you from anywhere at any time, so keep an eye out. He also said that several people have gone missing here from leopard attacks. I replied with, “I’d consider myself lucky if I could see one”. Then I lectured them about how it’s the human’s fault of capturing their land to make homes. That was enough to shut them up. After a couple of more small talks and few more pictures we reached our room. I was so tired that I couldn’t get up from the bed to even do my night routine of washing my face and brushing. But apparently there was more left to the night. These two didn’t sleep nor did they let me. So, we gossiped and laughed around for some more time. The time was 12.30am now and we knew we needed some rest for a big day tomorrow. All three of us had to go out to make a vlog on our selected temples. Those two had to go to Solan which is three more hours away from Shimla. Luckily mine was just three kms away from the room. Nevertheless, all three of us needed a good night sleep to feel rejuvenated for tomorrow. So, we switched of the lights and went to sleep. This time we actually slept. I had set the alarm for 6 am thinking I would wake up early and go out to shoot early expecting to capture the sunrise. But things never go as planned. I did wake up at 6 am but couldn’t do anything as the geyser didn’t turn on. No hot water meant no bathing which also meant I couldn’t go out.</p>

        <div class="container-sm">
            <h5 class="mt-5">Jakhoo Hanuman Temple</h5>
            <p class="lead">After successfully wasting 30 mins waiting for the water to heat which did not, I went back to bed. Then one of the guys woke up at 9 am and so did I. We spoke to the room care taker about the geyser not turning on. He gave us a key to another room which had an even bigger geyser. Both of us finished bathing, got ready and waited for the third guy to get ready. He was the stubborn one but was also the one who got us the room so couldn’t really say anything.</p>
            <p class="lead">Thankfully his friend got him up and all of us left the room together. We decided to have breakfast after our work is complete. I took a bus to Old Bus Stand and those two got a bus to New ISBT. I got down the at the lift and went up the ridge. The sun was bright and wasn’t the most ideal lighting condition for recording. But I didn’t have much choice. I didn’t really have a particular story board to follow. I just went with the flow. I wanted it to be as natural as possible hence it is called a vlog. The viewers watching should experience what I was experiencing for the first time. So, I started with taking some b-rolls. The church really gave a good starter shot. It brought into the scene. Because right behind the church, the tall statue of Hanuman was visible which gave my message as to where I was going but didn’t make it obvious. An easter egg is what it is called. I started walking towards the temple but for some reason I didn’t feel comfortable recording. I wasn’t socially lubricated is what I like to call. Maybe it had to do with the fact that I was alone. But I had no other choice but to keep on moving and recording. Afterall it was for an assignment. I waited till people went away before I started recording. Then I came across a board that said beware of the monkeys, they snatch anything you hold in hand and your spectacles. I was concerned because I was wearing spectacles and also carrying the vlogging kit. I kept walking forward with extreme caution. The temperature was 3 degrees but was bright and sunny. All of this paired with a steep gradient got me sweating. On the way I saw many people sitting down to take rest and catch their breath. But I was always on the move, never stopped except when taking pictures and recording videos which was almost instantaneous. By this point my legs were burning from all the climb and I wanted it to end. I made it to the top within 20 minutes. Should be some sort of a record, I guess. I made it to the arch and the first thing I noticed were lots of monkeys. A Hanuman temple without monkeys isn’t really a Hanuman temple. So, I went through the arch and along the way there were mantras written on every step you took.  </p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">Admiring The 108m Statue</h5>
            <p class="lead">I was finally closest possible to the statue and to get a complete look at it I had to tilt my head way up. It was massive. It was as tall as the <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/images/triund-peak-in-dhauladhar-ranges-as-seen-from-dharamkot-mcleodganj-dharamsala-himachal-pradesh-india-blue-skies-green-mountains-and-snow-with-tall-conifer-trees-beautiful-for-nature-walk/189527865" target="_blank">Dauladhar trees</a>. Surrounded by lush green trees, the statue stood out with its orangish-red color.  </p>
            <p class="lead">I took a few minutes to recover from the climb and then went ahead to shoot some more b-rolls of the statue. Then I went inside the temple to hopefully meet the pandit and get a few footages of him talking about the history of the place. Unfortunately, there were a lot of tourists and he was busy doing <a href="https://g.co/kgs/hwUbdP" target="_blank">Aarti</a> and <a href="https://g.co/kgs/LYFFds" target="_blank">Puja</a> . At this point I knew it was difficult for him to get free till lunch time so I let it be. Instead of feeling sad I thought to myself, “why don’t I make use of these tourists to capture their experiences on the visit to Jakhoo Hanuman temple”. And as I was thinking about this, I heard few people speaking in <a href="https://g.co/kgs/m775Cu" target="_blank">Kannada</a> . I straight away rushed to them and asked them in Kannada about how they felt about this place. They were shocked and excited to find another Kannadiga here. And so, they agreed to give an interview, a short one on how they felt about the place. They asked me what am I doing here and why am I studying so far away from home. Honestly, I am tired of answering this question so I think I should make a video on this, so that next time somebody asks me I’ll just share them the video. I get recognition as a video creator and they get their answer. After speaking to them I took some pictures of the surrounding, the trees, monkeys, tourists having fun, the statue and ropeway. Then I met few people from Panipat, Haryana. They were here for the first time and looked like they were having fun. Bunch of boys always have more fun than any other group, change my mind. So, I thought of interviewing them, again keeping it short. They did a great job, telling how they climbed their way up here looking at the statue and chanting his name gave them the energy to get here. Then I met another group of men who were from Punjab. They have been to Shimla a lot of times but first time visiting Jakhoo Hanuman Temple. They came up in taxi and planned on going back using Ropeway. They said the place eased their mind of stress. The part had to do with the lush green around them. All of the people I interviewed said the same thing, “Do visit this place for a refreshing experience and also an experience like no other”. A message to all of you reading this. If you ever come to Shimla do not miss Jakhoo Hanuman Temple. There are no restrictions on visiting the temple. You can enjoy this place without facing any sort of discrimination. You can also enjoy the ropeway. There’s taxi facility for those unable to climb. Hence it is a no brainer to visit Jakhoo Hanuman if you are in Shimla. The timings are 6 am to 8 pm.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">Wrapping Up</h5>
            <p class="lead">After interviewing tourists, I had to wrap up the video. But I couldn’t just yet as I forgot to record the history of the temple. I went looking for a place which had good lighting and where no tourists came in the frame. I found it. But instead of tourists there were a lot of monkeys. While I was filming, lot of monkeys walked past my bag. But they didn’t touch anything. They just passed by it like good, well-behaved monkeys.</p>
            <p class="lead">I had read about the history on the board put out nearby the entrance of the temple. I even googled some information. I could copy paste the history here to increase my word count, but I won’t, instead I’ll hyperlink it to the word "<a href="https://shimlatourism.co.in/jakhu-temple-shimla" target="_blank">history</a>" or just watch my video, I've explained it using cool animations ;) . I finished recording. I could have gone down using ropeway but I was too scared of heights. I was scared that the rope might cut lose and we’d fall from such height and there would be no Superman to save us. So, I let it be and chose to go down the same route I came up. While going back I saw another temple opposite to the arch of Jakhoo Hanuman. Naturally I was drawn to it and I went there. And while I was praying, I saw this monkey holding a shoe of a devotee who had left it there. The devotee came running and tried to shoo it but the monkey was clever enough to not let go of the shoe. The Pandit of the temple came out and offered it <a href="https://g.co/kgs/pV31VT" target="_blank">prasad</a> . It didn’t notice the prasad and climbed up. The pandit then threw the prasad up resulting in the monkey letting go of the shoe and catching the prasad. The monkeys here are very clever. And after I finished praying, I saw this other monkey near a water tap. It was opening the tap to drink water just like any other human would. It is fascinating to see how smart these monkeys have become. This makes me believe we truly are descendants of apes and monkeys. Apparently, these monkeys are agitated because Lord Hanuman broke his promise of visiting them during Ramayana. Since then, these monkeys have stayed here. Monkeys are known to move from place to place every few months. But these monkeys have stayed here since birth and die here waiting for Lord Hanuman to visit by. I met a few monkeys on the way back. Luckily, I had packed those 10 chapatis that one of my classmates had packed. Instead of him throwing them away I suggested to give it to me and I’ll feed the monkeys. It was a great idea as the monkeys seemed to enjoy it. I gave a chapati to every monkey i found on the way back. Now all I had to do was wait the other two guys to finish their videos and come back and meet me at The Ridge.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">The Fun Begins</h5>
            <p class="lead">I was very hungry at this stage after a vigorous climb. I went down looking for a place to eat breakfast. Found a lot of places but nothing really seemed healthy. There were too many people. It was a Saturday and we all know how weekends are at tourist places. Never visit tourist places on weekends unless you have no choice. Coming back to eating, I found a place that looked somewhat healthy. </p>
            <p class="lead">I was craving something oily and masaledar, which basically means spicy but not hot kind of spicy. It will only make sense if you are Indian and eat North Indian food. There was this small stall where the seats were full. Even then the waiter of the stall said there’s place for you too. Where was I supposed to sit? On top of other people’s head? The waiter then made some space by scooting people. It was congested. There was a family that sprung out with anger saying you guys are not letting us finish. “What is this behavior, we are locals. Let my children finish their meal and then we’ll leave”. To my eyes the kid had already finished eating. The family just looked like they wanted to pick fight. People these days… I then ordered <a href="https://g.co/kgs/GXAzr4" target="_blank">Chole Bhatura</a> . Chole has decent protein and Bhatura was the oiliness I was craving. Perfect Breakfast? I had three Bhaturas till I felt enough. The bill only got to 60 rupees. Definitely worth the money. Then I went looking for something else to eat. This is all there was left to do. Eat, explore, take pictures and explore some more and eat some more. So, I went up the ridge again looking for picturesque places. I did find a few amazing places to take pictures. The church was a good place to start. Then I moved on to a park which is next to the church. Lakkar Bazaar was also a good place to take pictures. You get to see entire Shimla from here. All the clogged houses on a mountain top looks unique. There were horses to ride too but I am way past the age of riding a horse. Instead, I felt sad that they are used as a medium of business. I hope they get sufficient food for all the work they do. Then my eyes laid on these long burgers I the street. Street food is truly the best and is way better than fancy restaurants, change my mind. Oh, and it only cost 30 rupees for each burger. I ordered one to have a taste. As soon as I took a bite into it, I knew I’m ordering another one. It was juicy and crispy at the same time. It was made with potato Tikki and roasted burger bread with butter and some sauces, probably green chili sauce and meetha which is a mixture of tamarind syrup and jaggery or sugar. After enjoying that I came down The Ridge and waited for my other two companions to arrive.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">The Fun Night Rises</h5>
            <p class="lead">The time was 5.30 pm and temperature was -3 degrees and my palms were freezing so much that I couldn’t move them. I called my classmates to check when are they coming. One of them picked up and said they will be coming a little late but agreed on having dinner together. They said they might come before 7.30 pm. So now I had two more hours to spend before having dinner. At this point I had already seen the entire Ridge only then to realize this is how small Shimla is.</p>
            <p class="lead">There isn’t much things to do here. For any of those travelers looking to come to Shimla, do not spend more than a day here. I began moving again because if you sit idle the cold is only going to get worse. I went out looking for a bonfire. I climbed all the way up to The Ridge again and in the Mall Road I found a bonfire put up by another random street vendor. What a relief to my hands. I took another stretch of walk in Lakkar Bazaar successfully wasting my time. At least it kept me warm. By now I had passed an hour worth of time just going and coming back. Soon I remembered one of my classmates telling me about taking me to PlayStation the previous night, but it gets closed before 7 pm and these guys were coming late. So, I decided to go by myself. Considering the name I thought it might be an Xbox and PlayStation hub, the gamers hub. But when I went inside it was a skating rink. Things suddenly got more interesting. Two girls and a guy were already skating there, barely knew how to stand. They looked locals. One of the girls looked at me and I looked back at her. I quickly bought a ticket for 30 minutes that cost you 80 rupees. They gave me a pair of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Quads+skates&sxsrf=AOaemvJjKMErTsGXNzDYL8qVd36ohp8MLw:1640283394077&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAoqPow_r0AhWVwjgGHbvXCm8Q_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=1536&bih=758&dpr=1.25" target="_blank">Quad Skates</a> . It had been 8 years since I last skated on Quads. My main go to skates is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Inline++speed+skates&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjo0M6LxPr0AhVm_zgGHVmSAEcQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Inline++speed+skates&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIHCCMQ7wMQJzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABFDmClisFGCBGmgAcAB4AIAB5QiIAeghkgEJNC0xLjUuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=TL3EYej6Cub-4-EP2aSCuAQ&bih=758&biw=1536" target="_blank">Inline</a> . I quickly got them on and entered the rink. They felt very loose. I might have forgotten how to ride them. I straight away was on the floor and all three of them started laughing. Yeah, that’s when I took things personally and started skating. Nobody forgets something that they have learnt especially as far as going to playing nationals. I was only out of touch. I slowly got the hang of it. The girls asked me “how on earth are you doing it? It seems impossible to stand on them” Then they asked me to teach them. As a gentleman I did. Then all four of us made a human train and of course the train derailed and everybody fell. We were having a lot of fun. They took Instagram videos of me skating elegantly. Then I got in full control of the skates and started speed skating. I even asked them to make a video of me skating. Those were truly the best 30 minutes of me in Shimla.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-5">Good Bye Shimla</h5>
            <p class="lead">After experiencing the best 30 minutes in Shimla, I still had 30 minutes left for dinner or that’s what I taught until I got a phone call from one of my classmates. They said they will be running late by an hour. Now I had to wait 2 hours more in the cold. </p>
            <p class="lead">One part of me said to just ditch them and eat dinner but another part of me wanted to wait because this trip was economical because of one of those guys. So, like every other good person I waited. I sat at a few places, I walked whenever I started feeling cold. But at this point I had already walked nearly 10 kms from morning. And remember 10 kms in Shimla is way harder than 10 kms elsewhere. I took a few night photos. I then went inside an art gallery expecting there will be room heater on. But I was wrong. I spent some time there admiring people’s creativity. Then I decided to go down The Ridge and wait near the lift because that is where they will come from. To later realize that they already reached The Ridge and are waiting for me at the church. In agony I went up again The Ridge and called them up only to later know they are apparently shopping a gift for one of the guy’s girlfriend. So, they asked me to wait near the tea stall we had been to prior night. I again came down The Ridge and stood near the tea stall. Another phone call comes and I really wanted this to end so that I could eat dinner. Guess it wasn’t enough walking for the day. They asked me to come up again near Lakkar Bazaar. I got furious and asked them to come down. But they made a fair point about dinner being available in Lakkar Bazaar is more economical and tasted better compared to here. So, I had no other choice but to go up again for a Ga zillionth time. They asked me to wait near Sher-E-Punjab a restaurant in Lakkar bazaar. I put on my headphones and started listening to calm music or else I would have killed them. Then they finally show up. I was just quiet and ignorant of them. We went to a fully vegetarian Dhaba which had terrible menu. I did not order anything. Only one of them ate there. The other one wanted to eat Chicken Tandoori with chilled beer. He had made it an obsession. Even though he was low on cash he wanted it. He got it and now I was the one left with no dinner. Imagine waiting for so long in the cold and not getting any dinner. Thankfully there was a fast-food shop open so I got myself Noodles and Manchurian. It was "filling" is all I can say. Then we got down The Ridge and bought beer. By now the time was 10.30 pm and obviously the lift was closed. So, we had no other option but to walk all the way to the room. In total I walked more than 15 kms. Tired and agitated I just wanted to go to bed. These guys finished eating meanwhile I did my night routine.</p>
            <p class="lead">Woke up the next day. I was surprised to not have any sore legs considering how much I had walked. Our bus back to Dharamshala was at 2.30 pm. All of us woke up at 9 am. One of the classmates had to go meet his girlfriend. And us two had to meet him at the Ridge by 12.30 pm so we don’t get late for the bus. Then apparently, we had to pay the room bill before he left to visit his girlfriend. Both of them went outside and came back a few minutes later saying they are charging 1500 rupees for 2 nights. They said "it is such an amazing deal". "250 per night is a steal" they said. Little did they know I already knew how much government rest houses cost thanks to a video I watched on YouTube. It costs around 75 – 150 per night. But even then, I trusted them and asked them for a bill. They said why do you need a bill. That was enough to conclude these guys are trying to scam me. Imagine scamming a person who has been living in metropolitan cities half of his life. So, I went with them to pay. One of the guys asked the other guy to take me back to room. Now I was hell bent on going there myself. The care taker of the rest house asked for 500 rupees for all three of us. That is roughly 166 per person for both the nights. I told my classmate I’ll transfer 166 online and went up to the room. Instead of meeting them at The Ridge at 12.30 pm I decided to leave right away. I packed my stuff and left saying "I have something to do before I leave", seemed like a neutral excuse to get out. So, I left and went straight to Old Bus stand. Found a good place to eat. Treated myself a lovely breakfast of Aloo Kulchas and Channa. Then I left to New ISBT in a fully electric Bus. I really hope this becomes a new normal. Electric buses are awesome. I reached the new Bus Stand and packed two aloo parathas for having it later during the journey. Booked a ticket and waited till 2.30 pm for the bus to move. Those guys did not make it to the Bus stand on time so they got on the bus mid-way near the bypass because of me. I had asked the driver and conductor to stop for two guys waving near bypass. The takeaway from this trip was that never trust anyone except yourself even if you think you know them. Don’t let people ruin your trips especially if you are a solo traveler. But also be kind no matter how bad the situation is.</p>
